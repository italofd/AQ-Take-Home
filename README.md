## Technology Choice / Why

- React + Vite: As this is a pretty simple project in terms of UI requirements, we will not need the new server actions, server components and others offered by NextJS, routing is also not a problem here and in that way, simplicity is key.
- Monaco: Most reliable and robust option for Code Editor component, includes supports for LSP and many languages and is highly customizable if you want to keep adding new stuff. Also works out of the box with react and the package maintainers for both of them are from microsoft itself and are not third party libraries.

### How to Get Started
