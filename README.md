## Technology Choice / Why

- NextJS: We are exclusively using NextJS for the deploy experience they offer, its much easier, with that said, we are not gonna use it to its full potential since the UI requirements of this projects are not elaborated enough to create boilerplate or unnecessary improvements.
- Monaco: Most reliable and robust option for Code Editor component, includes supports for LSP and many languages and is highly customizable if you want to keep adding new stuff. Also works out of the box with react and the package maintainers for both of them are from microsoft itself and are not third party libraries.
- Axios: The common fetching api from JS std library its not good, i prefer a solution that have already a better error management out of the box instead of i have to create boilerplate, axios have a humongous community and is usually the way to go for this kinda of task.
